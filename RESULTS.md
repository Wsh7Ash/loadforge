## Commands executed
```shell
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pytest -q
loadforge --help
loadforge plan 100 30
python ../../logs/2026-10-24/run_demos.py   # writes results/demo-output.txt
```

## Observed result

- `pip install -e .` exited 0 in a clean venv; console script `loadforge` resolves.
- `pytest -q` exited 0: 9 passed in 3.29s
- CLI smoke: [{"cmd": ["loadforge", "--help"], "expected": 0, "actual": 0}, {"cmd": ["loadforge", "plan", "100", "30"], "expected": 0, "actual": 0}]
- Demo harness ran every workflow with asserted exit codes; full transcript in
  [`results/demo-output.txt`](results/demo-output.txt).

## Generated artifacts
- `results/demo-output.txt` — captured demo transcript with per-command exit codes
